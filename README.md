### Malware-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

## About The Project

* This project analyzes PE information of executable files to detect malware.
* In this repository, you will learn how to create your own dataset and see the use of machine learning models using the dataset.
* We will use machine learning to detect malware.

## Getting Started
This PE information was extracted using `pefile`.

If you want to create your own dataset, check out `Data_Set_Generator.ipynb`

or you can use `data-set/MalwareDataSet.csv`

## Dataset

This dataset (MalwareDataSet.csv) contains a total of `137,444` entries. 
There are `96,526` safe entries and `40,918` malware entries.

It has a total of 9 columns. The information of these columns is as follows:
```
* AddressOfEntryPoint
* MajorLinkerVersion
* MajorImageVersion
* MajorOperatingSystemVersion
* DllCharacteristics
* SizeOfStackReserve
* NumberOfSections
* ResourceSize
* legitimate
```

## Classification

We used 3 different classification algorithms. These are:
```
* K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
```

## Results
```
The success rate was calculated as 97.56118855679404% with the K-Nearest-Neighbors

The success rate was calculated as 98.59433660254359% with the Decision Tree

The success rate was calculated as 99.1240068682518% with the Random Forest
